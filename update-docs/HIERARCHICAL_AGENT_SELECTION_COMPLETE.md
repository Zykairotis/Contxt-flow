# Hierarchical Agent Selection System - Complete

## ✅ Implementation Complete for src/cli/simple-commands/hive-mind.js

### Changes Summary

**✅ Removed All Emojis** - Clean, professional text-only interface

**✅ Hierarchical Two-Step Selection:**
1. **Step 1:** Select categories (15 total)
2. **Step 2:** Select specific agents from each category

**✅ ALL 74+ Agents Included** - Organized in 15 categories

## Two-Step Selection Flow

### Step 1: Categories (15 options)
```
Step 1: Select agent categories:

□ Core Development - Essential development agents for coding, testing, and planning
□ Analysis & Architecture - Code analysis, architecture design, and performance optimization  
□ Specialized Development - Domain-specific development specialists
□ Coordination & Orchestration - Multi-agent coordination and task orchestration
□ Consensus & Synchronization - Distributed consensus and synchronization protocols
□ Performance & Monitoring - Performance analysis, monitoring, and optimization
□ GitHub Integration - GitHub operations, PRs, issues, and releases
□ DevOps & CI/CD - DevOps, CI/CD, deployment, and operations
□ Documentation - API documentation and technical writing
□ SPARC Methodology - SPARC development methodology agents
□ Goal Planning - Goal-oriented planning and execution
□ Swarm Management - Swarm-specific management and coordination
□ Neural & AI - Neural networks and AI operations
□ Flow-Nexus Platform - Flow-Nexus platform integration features
□ Templates & Utilities - Template generation and utility agents
```

### Step 2: Agents Per Category
For each selected category, shows specific agents with descriptions.
